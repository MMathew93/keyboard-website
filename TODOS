        -Admin will be able to Create, Update, and Delete products
2. Set up general Pages for products
    -Set it up so that when an admin creates, updates or deletes a product, product pages get corrected
3. Set up individual pages for specific products

%%%%%%%%%BUGS // ISSUES%%%%%%%%%%%%
1. Can't access views within subfolder `Product_Main-Page` inside Views folder
2. Navbar is cut off when opening info tab
    -Navbar dropdowns are open when accessing from hamburger (when screen is small)
3. Make Registration page more tight knit on form filling, patterns, rules, etc (zip should only take numbers and be 5 long)
4. Color Registration submit button
5. Controller folder in server was removed. Anti-Pattern? Seperates business logic from the route, but was having issues. A route is a controller
